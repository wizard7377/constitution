# The New Constitution 

This is an example of a revised constitution for the United States of America.

## The Core Questions

For a little bit of an overview:

### Who?

Me, Asher Frost.
Of course, if there are any issues you might have with this, or and ideas you have, I'd be happy to discuss them `:)`.

### What?

Written as a theoretical replacement for the US constitution, this includes:

1. A new preamble
2. The main text, of course 
3. A bill of rights
4. Supplementary matterial including:
   1. A map of the current consitution to this
   2. Notes on this
   3. A key for changes

While obviously this probably will never be passed, we try to keep this as practical as possible.
Namely, we try and make the "transition" smooth enough as to allow society to keep on functioning 

### Where?

The United States...?

### When?

I first had this idea a couple of years ago.
However, this draft started in 2025.

#### Now?

This is actually I think somewhat important.
We often think of the Constitution as the very "core" of America.
We had the Articles of Confederation before the Constitution, however.

None of the founders were so arrogant as to assume there was perfect, they included the ability to amend in the Articles of Confederation.
However, upon realizing that they were having an easier time rewriting then ammending the articles, in the constitution they reduced the original consesues required to merely a 2/3 majority. 

We often forget that the constitution was never meant to exist, unchanged, forever.
It was meant to be changed, as it itself *was a change*.

### Why?

Going off the previous point, I am not neccasairlly advocating for a rewrite of the consitituion (especially not this attempt, which is far from complete).
Rather, I hope to invoke some fundemental questioning among the reader, such as:

- Why do we have a first past the post system when this leads to a two party system?
- Why are states given so much importance both in the electoral college and legislature?
- Why do we effectivly defer the power of ammending the consititution to the Supreme Court?
- Why do we protect certain rights that are not explicityly given yet encroach on those written expressly.

Through questions like these, I hope we can become a "beacon of democracy around the world".
