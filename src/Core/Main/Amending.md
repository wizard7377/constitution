###

Either the House of Representatives, upon a vote of 3/5, or the Senate, upon a vote of 4/5, shall be able to propose amendments to this constitution.
However, if an amendment is agreed upon by both 3/5 of the House and 4/5 of the Senate, it immediately takes effect.

###

A proposed amendment that is not passed by the above majority in both houses, shall be put on each person’s ballot at the next election.
If more of the people vote for the amendment than against, not counting those abstaining, the amendment immediately takes effect.
