## Congress

### Composition

The legislative powers of the United States shall be vested in a Congress, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives.

### Elections and Requirements

::: Comment 
This repeals all the other restrictions on represntatives and senators. 
Given the fact that there is basically nothing other than holding certain office being prohibited after 21, it dosen't make much sense to have specifically that 
::: 


No person shall be a congressman **in the house or in the senate,** who is not yet **21** years of age and a United States citizen.
A person is disqualified from being a congressman of one state if, during the same election year, they have been on the ballot in some other state during that same election year.

Whenever a vacancy occurs in either the House or Senate, writ of elections shall be issued to fill such vacencies

### Term And Representatives

Each district shall have two representatives, such that each representative has the term of half an election cycle, each offset by two years from the other, being elected on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th year.

Representatives shall be elected by **ranked-choice** vote in a given district.

Each state shall have 4 senators, such that each senator serves 8 years, with terms similarly offset, and concurrent with the representatives.
**State legislatures shall appoint senators.**

### Congressional procedure

A majority of the congressmen are required to engage in debate.
**However, if, at any point, either chamber recesses for a time in excess of 30 days, or for more than half the days out of the year, the members of such similar absenteeism shall be investigated for contempt of Congress**.

Each body shall decide the rules, as well as its officers, as well as the chair, upon affirmation of 3/5 of those there.
Further, Congress shall have the power to declare a president pro tempe.

To expel a member, 2/3 of those present are required.
**Such an expulsion may not be in excess of 30 days, or be for more than half the days out of the year, and such an expulsion does not count against the service in congress**.
**No person imprisoned for a crime may become a congressman while they are imprisoned; however, when they are released, they may seek office, and shall not be forbidden from doing so**.

::: Comment 
Again, uniformity is different
::: 

### Impeachments 
The House shall have the power of impeachment, however, the Senate shall have the power to decide such a case upon such impeachments.
Congress shall be under oath whenever considering a case of impeachments, and, when any executor or congressperson is tried, a federal judge shall preside.
An impeachment shall only occur upon affirmation of 2/3rds of the members present, and may not issue fines, sentences, or anything beyond simple removal from office. 

Any party impeached shall be held liable seperatly to any criminal or civil violations, which shall be a seperate issue

### Votes 

The votes on all motions, as well as recusals, shall be known for each congressmen for each motion.
In the case that either the house or Senate is tied in their vote, the executive shall break such a tie.


### Legislative Process

To pass a bill, either 1/2 of the house or 3/5 of the senate, as well as the executive's approval, shall be required.
However, if there is agreement of 3/5 of the house, the bill may be passed without the executives approval. 
Similarly, if 1/2 of the house and 2/3 of the senate agree, then the bill becomes law.
