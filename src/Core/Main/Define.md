Election cycles and census -
:::

Election cycles last 8 years, starting from the adoption of this constitution.

Every 2nd election cycle, on the first year of that cycle, not including the year this constitution is adopted, a census shall be performed. 
This census shall be conducted in a non-partisan manner, and must count the number of persons in each state eligible to vote 

### 
<!-- The districts
This sounds more complex then it is.
Basically:
1. Find the voter percentage of any given region wrt the US, multiply it by 250
2. If that is less than 1, remove it for consideration
3. Take the number of regions effected by 2 and subtract that number from 250 
4. Find the voter percentage of all the states not removed in 2, and apply 1 except 

DC and Puerto Rico 
This just means that if they become states they don't get to have the clause apply
-->
After each census, the electoral districts shall be distributed to the regions according to their voters, such that average weighted variance by voter per region of districts of voters per district shall be minimized.
However, no region shall have zero districts.
Each state shall form its own district, **as do the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, so long as they do not belong to some other region.**

Ranked Choice Voting 
:::

Whenever a vote shall be mentioned as taking place by "ranked choice", it refers to the following.
Each ballot shall have choices marked in order from the highest preference to the lowest preference, with any number potentially not marked.
All these ballots are counted, and whoever has the least number of votes is removed from consideration. 

Then, the ballots are recast, with all instances of the eliminated candidate being removed from consideration, and all other candidates shifted up accordingly. 
Ballots are recast until only one candidate remains, with that being the choice, and the second being second choice, and the others being ordered likewise.
