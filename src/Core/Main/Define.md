<!--- Definitions -->


### Section 
<!--- Electoral districts -->

There shall be, within the United States, 250 electoral districts, whose boundaries shall be determined by the state in which the district is located; however, upon a vote of 3/5 in either the Senate or the House of Representatives, the boundaries shall be determined by the federal government, such that the district still lies within the state, and is permissible.
In addition, an apportionment among the territories shall be decided by Congress.

A district may not lie on two or more states.
A district must be continuous (either by land or by sea).
Every point in the United States, or territories thereof, must lie within a district.

Each state shall be given districts proportional to its population, but no state may have zero districts.
In addition, at least 1 district must be assigned to the collective territories of the United States.
The District of Columbia shall have its own distinct district, which may not be affected by any act of Congress.

The population of each state shall be determined by a fair thorough census, conducted once every 16 years, not taking effect until the next election.
Each district must be bound by established borders.

### Section 
<!--- Ranked Choice Voting -->

Whenever a vote shall be mentioned as taking place by "ranked choice", it refers to the following.
Each ballot shall have choices marked in order from highest preference to lowest preference, with any number potentially not marked.
All these ballots are counted, and whoever has the least number of votes is removed from consideration. 

Then, the ballots are recast, with all instances of the eliminated candidate being removed from consideration, and all other candidates shifted up accordingly. 
Ballots are recast until only one candidate remains, with that being the choice, and the second being second choice, and the others being ordered likewise.
