# Preamble

When the parties control the people;
When those not elected effectively create the law;
When the system in place is abused;
When the milartary turns its back on freedom and democracy;
When those in cities are systematically underrepresented;
When the people are not secure in their rights;
When the states are not safe in their soverienty;

And when those people realize these, it is their right, it is their duty, to improve upon their goverment, and to control their politics;
To ensure those who write the law are those elected;
To create new systems of checks and balences
To create a milatary that is subservient to the people it claims to represent
To create a proportional system of representation 
To guarantee that each state have some autonomy;

It is for these reasons, that we, the people of the United States, come together today and make a new constitution, that shall protect us and allow us to prosper under a free world. 
Therein, from here is written the text of the new constitution of the United States of America.
