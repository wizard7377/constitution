# Key for Reading 

We have editorial annotations, written with normal text, *italics*, **bold**, and ***bolded italics***. 
Each of these seeks to differentiate the issue being addressed as well as the results:'

- Normal text: intended to be consistent with the constitution 
- *Italics*: Codifying a supreme court (or lower court) decision[^1] 
- **Bold**: effectively a change in the constitution
- ***Bolded italics***: effectively overruling a supreme court decision 

## Subjectivity 

This is not copied directly from the Constitution, both because I wanted it to be inspired by the constitution, instead of just changing it, and because I wanted to modernize the language.
That being said, what is and isn't amending and what is and isn't codifying are... matters of debate.

Yes, I am the final judge of what that is.
Many will argue certain (or all, depending on how much "review" the judiciary really has) of the changes that mentioned as being "codified" actually already existed.
Again, I'm the final judge, if you don't like it, just ignore it.
