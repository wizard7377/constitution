### Electoral districts 
The original constitution did not use many terms, as the system created, while allowing complexity in its practice, in its theory was a simple system.
Because we use definitions that are a fair bit more in depth, we define them first.

The electoral district change fairly little from the constitution, they were mostly working fine.
Most importantly, we give each state at *least* one district.
While techinically unfair, this is permissible and neccassary to preserve state distinctions.
States get districts, and then lines are drawn on those districts.

We change a number of things, however:
- The district of columbia gets only one district, but they are allowed to vote for a representative 
- The terrotories get their own distrct 

Apart from this, there are a couple rules intended to prevent gerrymandering:
- A district must lie entierly in one state (already in practice)
- A district must be contious (already in practice)
- a district must not be drawn arbitrarly (not in practice)

### Ranked Choice Voting

Ranked choice voting, also instant runoff voting, was chosen here, and is among the larger changes made here
